                <h1>Terms of Conditions</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated: January 12, 2026</strong></p>
<h2>1. Introduction and Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>conthunt</strong> (“App”, “Service”, “Platform”), a sophisticated AI-powered content research and analysis tool owned and operated by <strong>Synthenova Enterprises LLP</strong> (“Company”, “We”, “Us”, “Our”).</p>
<p>By accessing, downloading, installing, registering for, or using the conthunt application (available at <a href="https://conthunt.app">https://conthunt.app</a>) and its associated services, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and websites, you (“User”, “You”, “Your”) acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Conditions (“Terms”) and our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT USE OUR SERVICES.</strong></p>
<p>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between You and Synthenova Enterprises LLP, a Limited Liability Partnership registered in India, with its principal place of business at <strong>Anna Nagar, Chennai 600040, India</strong>.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify, amend, or replace these Terms at any time at our sole discretion. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Terms on our website or within the App. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically for updates.</p>
<h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
<p>conthunt is an advanced content intelligence platform designed for creators, marketers, and businesses. Our Service leverages state-of-the-art technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), to provide deep insights into digital content.</p>
<p>Core features of the Service include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content Discovery</strong>: Searching and aggregating content from various social media and digital platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Video Analysis</strong>: Utilizing advanced AI (powered by partners like TwelveLabs) to index, analyze, and extract metadata, context, and actionable insights from video content.</li>
<li><strong>Data Aggregation</strong>: Interfacing with third-party data providers (such as ScrapeCreators) to fetch public metrics and content performace data.</li>
<li><strong>Search and indexing</strong>: providing semantic search capabilities over video and text content.</li>
</ul>
<p>You understand and agree that the Service is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. We do not guarantee that the Service will always be safe, secure, or error-free, or that the Service will always function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections.</p>
<h2>3. Account Registration and Security</h2>
<h3>3.1. Account Creation</h3>
<p>To access the full functionality of conthunt, you must register for an account. We utilize secure third-party authentication services (such as Google Firebase Auth) to manage user identities. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to keep your account information updated.</p>
<h3>3.2. Account Security</h3>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. Synthenova Enterprises LLP will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section.</p>
<h3>3.3. Eligibility</h3>
<p>You must be at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use our Services. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into this agreement and to abide by all of the terms and conditions set forth herein.</p>
<h2>4. Credits, Subscriptions, and Billing</h2>
<h3>4.1. The Credit System</h3>
<p>conthunt operates on a usage-based credit system. Credits are the currency of the platform used to perform actions. Different actions consume different amounts of credits based on the computational resources and third-party costs required.</p>
<p><strong>Credit Consumption Rates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search Query</strong>: Consumes <strong>1 Credit</strong> per query. This includes keyword searches across our indexed content.</li>
<li><strong>Video Analysis</strong>: Consumes <strong>2 Credits</strong> per analysis event. This involves deep retrieval of insights from a specific video.</li>
<li><strong>Video Indexing</strong>: Consumes <strong>5 Credits</strong> per video indexed. This is a resource-intensive process where we process raw video data to make it searchable.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rates are subject to change at our discretion. We will make reasonable efforts to notify users of significant changes to credit consumption rates.</p>
<h3>4.2. Subscriptions and Plans</h3>
<p>We offer various subscription tiers (“Plans”), including but not limited to “Free”, “Creator”, and “Pro/Research”.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free Tier</strong>: Limited monthly credits (e.g., 50 credits) for trial and casual use.</li>
<li><strong>Paid Tiers</strong>: Higher credit limits (e.g., 1000 or 3000 credits) and access to advanced features.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subscriptions are billed in advance on a recurring monthly or annual basis.</p>
<h3>4.3. Payment Processing</h3>
<p>We use <strong>Dodo</strong> (and potentially other third-party payment processors) to securely handle all financial transactions. We do not store your complete credit card information on our servers. By subscribing to a paid plan, you authorize us and our payment processors to charge the applicable fees to your designated payment method.</p>
<h3>4.4. Auto-Renewal</h3>
<p>Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel it before the renewal date. You can manage and cancel your subscription through your account settings on the conthunt platform.</p>
<h2>5. Refund and Cancellation Policy (Dodo)</h2>
<h3>5.1 Subscription Cancellation (Stop Future Renewals)</h3>
<p>You may cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings. Cancellation stops future renewals and takes effect at the end of your current billing period. You will continue to have access to the Service until the end of the billing period.</p>
<h3>5.2 Consumer Right to Cancel (14 Days) — Where Applicable</h3>
<p>If you are a consumer, you may have the right to cancel your purchase within <strong>14 days</strong> starting from the day after the transaction is completed, without giving any reason, unless a legal exception applies.</p>
<p><strong>Important digital-service exception:</strong> This cancellation right may not apply once you have started accessing or receiving the benefit of the digital service/content (for example, once usage/access has begun).</p>
<h3>5.3 Refunds</h3>
<p>Payments for conthunt may be processed by <strong>Dodo</strong>, acting as the Merchant of Record. Refunds are handled by Dodo in line with Dodo’s buyer/consumer terms and applicable law. Refund requests may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may be refused in cases such as suspected fraud or abuse.</p>
<p>This does not affect your statutory rights (for example, where a product/service is not as described, faulty, or not fit for purpose).</p>
<h3>5.4 How to Request a Cancellation or Refund</h3>
<p>For the fastest processing, submit your request through Dodo’s support / buyer help channels. You may also contact us at <strong>support@conthunt.app</strong> and we will help route your request, but Dodo may require additional information to process the request.</p>
<h2>6. User Conduct and Restrictions</h2>
<p>You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful or prohibited purpose. You specifically agree NOT to:</p>
