## 3. Account Registration and Security

### 3.1. Account Creation

You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to keep your account information updated.

## 4. Credits, Subscriptions, and Billing

### 4.1. The Credit System
conthunt operates on a usage-based credit system. Credits are the currency of the platform used to perform actions. Different actions consume different amounts of credits based on the computational resources and third-party costs required.

**Credit Consumption Rates:**
*   **Search Query**: Consumes **1 Credit** per query. This includes keyword searches across our indexed content.
*   **Video Analysis**: Consumes **2 Credits** per analysis event. This involves deep retrieval of insights from a specific video.
*   **Video Indexing**: Consumes **5 Credits** per video indexed. This is a resource-intensive process where we process raw video data to make it searchable.

These rates are subject to change at our discretion. We will make reasonable efforts to notify users of significant changes to credit consumption rates.

### 4.2. Subscriptions and Plans
We offer various subscription tiers ("Plans"), including but not limited to "Free", "Creator", and "Pro/Research".
*   **Free Tier**: Limited monthly credits (e.g., 50 credits) for trial and casual use.
*   **Paid Tiers**: Higher credit limits (e.g., 1000 or 3000 credits) and access to advanced features.

Subscriptions are billed in advance on a recurring monthly or annual basis.

### 4.3. Payment Processing
We use **Dodo** (and potentially other third-party payment processors) to securely handle all financial transactions. We do not store your complete credit card information on our servers. By subscribing to a paid plan, you authorize us and our payment processors to charge the applicable fees to your designated payment method.

### 4.4. Auto-Renewal
Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel it before the renewal date. You can manage and cancel your subscription through your account settings on the conthunt platform.

## 5. Refund and Cancellation Policy (Dodo)

### 5.1 Subscription Cancellation (Stop Future Renewals)
You may cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings. Cancellation stops future renewals and takes effect at the end of your current billing period. You will continue to have access to the Service until the end of the billing period.

### 5.2 Consumer Right to Cancel (14 Days) — Where Applicable
If you are a consumer, you may have the right to cancel your purchase within **14 days** starting from the day after the transaction is completed, without giving any reason, unless a legal exception applies.

**Important digital-service exception:** This cancellation right may not apply once you have started accessing or receiving the benefit of the digital service/content (for example, once usage/access has begun).

### 5.3 Refunds
Payments for conthunt may be processed by **Dodo**, acting as the Merchant of Record. Refunds are handled by Dodo in line with Dodo’s buyer/consumer terms and applicable law. Refund requests may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may be refused in cases such as suspected fraud or abuse.

This does not affect your statutory rights (for example, where a product/service is not as described, faulty, or not fit for purpose).

### 5.4 How to Request a Cancellation or Refund
For the fastest processing, submit your request through Dodo’s support / buyer help channels. You may also contact us at **support@conthunt.app** and we will help route your request, but Dodo may require additional information to process the request.
