## 11) Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect personal data against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration, or disclosure.

However, no system is 100% secure. You are responsible for keeping your account credentials safe and for using strong authentication practices.

## 12) International Data Transfers

conthunt may store or process data on servers located outside your state/province/country (for example, where our cloud providers operate). Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.
