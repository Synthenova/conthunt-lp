## Creating Business Content That Converts

Business content on Shorts must balance value and self-promotion. Use this framework:

**The 80/20 Rule:**
- 80% value (education, inspiration, entertainment)
- 20% promotion (your products, services, offers)

**Structure for Business Shorts:**
1. **Problem identification (5-10 seconds):** State a pain point
2. **Solution or insight (30-40 seconds):** Deliver value
3. **Proof or example (10 seconds):** Show it works
4. **CTA (5 seconds):** What to do next

**Key Principles:**
- Lead with value, not features
- Show results, don't just promise
- Be specific, not generic
- Include real examples whenever possible
- Make the next step clear

## Building Your Business Content Strategy

The most successful business Shorts accounts use this approach:

**Content Pillars (3-5 topics):**
- Educational content (teaching your expertise)
- Behind-the-scenes (showing your process)
- Social proof (testimonials, case studies)
- Industry commentary (news, trends, opinions)

**Posting Frequency:**
- Minimum 4-5 Shorts per week for algorithm favor
- Batch film content to maintain consistency
- Repurpose existing content into Shorts format
- Use scheduling tools for consistency

**Measurement Matters:**
Track which business content drives:
- Website clicks (traffic quality)
- Lead form submissions (conversion)
- Product purchases (revenue)
- Demo requests (pipeline)
- Brand search volume (awareness)
