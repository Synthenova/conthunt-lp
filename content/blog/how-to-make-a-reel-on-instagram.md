## Troubleshooting

### Reel Won't Upload

- Accept some compression is normal

### Audio Not Syncing

**Solutions:**

- Update Instagram app
- Restart and try again

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Ignoring Trending Audio

**Problem**: Missing out on discoverability.

**Solution**: Browse trending audio before creating.

### Mistake 2: Poor Lighting

**Problem**: Grainy, unappealing video.

**Solution**: Film in good natural light or invest in a ring light.

### Mistake 3: Weak Opening

**Problem**: Boring first few seconds.

**Solution**: Start with action, movement, or compelling text.

### Mistake 4: No Text Overlays

**Problem**: Viewers don't understand context quickly.

**Solution**: Add text to explain key points or provide context.

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Call-to-Action

**Problem**: Viewers watch but don't engage further.

**Solution**: Always include a CTA (follow, like, share, visit link).

## Advanced Tips

### Create Loops

Make your Reel loop seamlessly:
- End connects visually to beginning
- Cut on motion for smoother edit
- Encourages rewatching

### Use the Align Feature

Perfect transitions between clips:
1. Enable **Align** tool
2. Use previous clip as overlay
3. Match position for next shot
4. Create smooth transitions

### Cross-Platform Strategy

Create once, post everywhere:
- Record at 9:16 aspect ratio
- Post to Instagram Reels
- Repost to TikTok
- Repost to YouTube Shorts
- Adapt caption for each platform
