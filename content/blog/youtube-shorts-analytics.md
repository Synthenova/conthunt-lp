answer_first:
  text: "In 2026, **YouTube Shorts Analytics** (residing within YouTube Studio) revolve around one core metric: **'Viewed vs. Swiped Away'**. Because Shorts are 'Push' content, your success depends on whether the algorithm can find users who *choose* to stay. For the advanced creator, the secondary metric of importance is **'Bridge Conversion'**—the percentage of viewers who move from your Shorts to your long-form videos. Using **ContHunt**, you can normalize these metrics against $industry benchmarks to see where you truly stand."
faq_items:
  - question: "What is the 'Viewed vs. Swiped Away' metric in 2026?"
    answer: "This metric replaced old-school impressions. It shows the percentage of people who saw your video in their feed and watched it for at least 3 seconds. In 2026, you need at least a **70% 'Viewed' rate** to go viral."
  - question: "How do I see where my Shorts traffic is coming from?"
    answer: "In the 'Reach' tab of YouTube Studio, look at **'Traffic Sources'**. In 2026, high-performing Shorts see a mix of 'Shorts Feed' (for discovery) and 'YouTube Search' (for long-term evergreen traffic)."
  - question: "Can I track competitor Shorts analytics in 2026?"
    answer: "YouTube does not provide this directly. However, **ContHunt** aggregates public performance data to give you a **'Relative Velocity'** score for your competitors, helping you spot trends before they go mainstream."

# Mastering YouTube Shorts Analytics in 2026

Short-form video has changed the way we measure success. In 2026, you cannot manage what you do not measure. But to measure correctly, you have to look past the "Vanity Metrics" of the past and focus on the "Decision Metrics" of the future.

## 1. The Decision Metric: Viewed vs. Swiped Away
This is the ultimate filter of the 2026 algorithm.
*   **The Data:** YouTube tells you exactly how many people "Passed" on your video.
*   **The Analysis:** If your 'Swiped Away' rate is high, your hook is failing. 
*   **The Fix:** Use **ContHunt** to analyze the first 0.5 seconds of your video. We identify if the visual disruption is too slow or if the text overlay is mismatched with the audience node.

## 2. Retention Beyond the Hook
Once you stop the swipe, you have to keep them watching.
*   **The Drop-off Point:** Look for the steepest decline in your retention graph. This usually happens when a joke lands, a tutorial slows down, or a transition is jarring.
*   **The 2026 Standard:** Viral videos in 2026 maintain a "Flat Line" until the 80% mark.
*   **Benchmarking with ContHunt:** We provide a **'Niche Retention Average'**. If your video drops off at 15 seconds but the average in your niche is 20 seconds, you are losing millions of potential views.

## 3. Bridge Conversion and Channel Health
In 2026, the purpose of a Short is often to drive traffic to something bigger.
*   **Bridge Conversion Rate:** This measures how many people clicked a "Related Video" or "Link in Description."
*   **Sub Gain per 1,000 Views:** This is the ultimate measure of "Account Affinity." If you are getting views but no subs, your content is entertaining but not building a personal brand.

## 4. The 2026 Analytics Workflow
1.  **T+1 Hour:** Check 'Viewed vs. Swiped Away'. If it is below 50%, consider deleting and re-optimizing the hook.
2.  **T+24 Hours:** Analyze the 'Traffic Sources'. If 'Search' is high, your SEO is working.
3.  **Weekly:** Review your **ContHunt Success Index** to see if your channel's velocity is increasing relative to your niche peers.
