## Analytics Dashboard Deep Dive

### Instagram Reels Analytics: What Creators See

Instagram provides basic analytics for Reels, but transparency remains limited:

**Available Metrics:**
- Views (total, accounts reached)
- Likes, comments, shares
- Saves
- Plays (with audio)
- Insights for professional accounts
- Reach vs. views
- Follower growth from Reel
- Discovery rate (percentage reached non-followers)

**What's Missing:**
- Watch time data
- Retention graphs
- Detailed demographics
- Revenue per Reel
- Individual Reel click-through rates
- Traffic source breakdown

**Key Limitation:**
Instagram's analytics don't show how long viewers watch or when they drop off, making it difficult to optimize content for retention.

### YouTube Shorts Analytics: Superior Data

YouTube provides significantly more actionable analytics:

**Available Metrics:**
- Views with view duration tracking
- Average view duration
- Audience retention graphs (per video)
- Click-through rate
- Detailed traffic sources
- Viewer demographics (age, gender, location)
- Subscriber growth per Short
- Revenue per 1,000 views (RPM)
- Related video performance
- Search traffic data

**Key Advantage:**
Retention graphs show exactly where viewers drop off, allowing creators to optimize content for maximum engagement.

**Winner: YouTube Shorts by a significant margin**

## Algorithm Behavior: How Content Gets Discovered

### Instagram Reels Algorithm

**How It Works:**
The Reels algorithm prioritizes content that keeps users on the platform longer and encourages interaction.

**Key Ranking Factors:**

2. **Engagement** (likes, comments, shares, saves)
3. **Re-watch value** (do they watch again?)
4. **Audio/trend usage**
5. **Relationship to creator** (do they follow you?)
6. **Session time** (does it keep them scrolling?)

**Algorithm Characteristics:**
- Heavy emphasis on trend participation
- Audio choice significantly affects reach
- Explore page distribution possible
- Follower reach still matters more than YouTube
- Content typically has 24-48 hour viral window

**Best For:**

### YouTube Shorts Algorithm

**How It Works:**

3. **Engagement signals** (likes, comments, shares)
4. **Subscriber conversions** (do they subscribe?)
5. **Watch history correlation** (similar to what they watch)
6. **Session time** (do they keep watching?)
7. **Search relevance**

**Algorithm Characteristics:**
