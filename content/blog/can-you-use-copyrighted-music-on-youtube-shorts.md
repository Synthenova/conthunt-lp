# Can You Use Copyrighted Music on YouTube Shorts in 2026?

One of the most common questions for new creators in 2026 is whether they can use their favorite songs in their YouTube Shorts without getting a copyright strike. The answer is a resounding **yes**, but there are specific rules and tools you must use to ensure your channel stays safe and your videos remain monetized.

## The 2026 Solution: The Shorts Audio Library

The simplest and safest way to use copyrighted music is through the built-in **Shorts Audio Library**. In 2026, this library contains millions of licensed tracks from major labels and independent artists.

### How It Works
When you use a song from the library within the YouTube Shorts creation tool (or via the mobile app), YouTube assumes the responsibility for the licensing. You don't have to worry about copyright strikes, and your video will not be blocked.

### Impact on Monetization
Using music from the library does not prevent you from making money. However, it does change how your earnings are calculated:
1.  YouTube collects all ad revenue from the Shorts feed.
2.  They pay the music publishers their licensing fees out of the "Creator Pool."
3.  The remaining revenue is then split among creators, with you receiving **45%** of your allocated share.

## What Happens if You Upload Your Own Music?

If you edit your video in third-party software (like CapCut or Premiere Pro) using a copyrighted song you downloaded, and then upload it to YouTube, the **Content ID** system will likely flag it.

*   **Copyright Claims:** Usually, this just means the ad revenue goes to the music owner instead of you.
*   **Copyright Strikes:** If the owner is particularly strict, they could issue a strike, which can lead to channel termination after three offenses.
*   **Muting:** In some cases, YouTube will simply mute the audio or block the video in certain countries.

**Pro Tip:** If you want to use an external song, check if it's available in the Shorts Library first. If it is, you can often "overlay" the library version during the upload process to stay compliant.

## Introducing YouTube Creator Music

For creators who want more control or want to use music for longer than 60 seconds, YouTube has introduced **Creator Music**. This platform allows you to:
*   **Buy Licenses:** Pay a one-time fee to use a song and keep 100% of your revenue share.
*   **Revenue Share:** Use certain songs in exchange for sharing a portion of your earnings directly with the artist.

## Best Practices for Music in 2026

1.  **Use the Native Editor:** Whenever possible, add music using the YouTube mobile app's "Add sound" feature. This is the only 100% strike-proof method.
2.  **Check for "No Attribution" Requirements:** Most library tracks don't require you to credit the artist, but it's good practice to keep an eye on any specific terms listed in the library info.
3.  **Monitor Your Studio:** Check the **"Copyright"** tab in your YouTube Studio regularly to ensure no unexpected claims have appeared on your older content.

## Conclusion

Using copyrighted music in 2026 is easier than ever, provided you stay within the ecosystem YouTube has built. By using the **Shorts Audio Library** and **Creator Music**, you can enhance your videos with trending tracks while keeping your channel in good standing and your monetization active.
