SpyFu specializes in search marketing research. It allows you to see every keyword your competitors have ever bought on Google Ads, and every organic rank they’ve had over the last 15 years.

A browser extension that instantly shows you the technology stack of any website you visit. It's the fastest way to see if a competitor is using Shopify, WordPress, or custom code.
