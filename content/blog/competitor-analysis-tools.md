  text: "In 2026, the best **competitor analysis tools** prioritize **'Algorithmic Benchmarking'** over simple follower tracking. While legacy tools like Social Blade still offer basic growth stats, platforms like **ContHunt** have taken the lead by offering **'Relative Performance Index (RPI)'** and **'Node Overlap'** data. The modern creator needs to know not just that a rival is growing, but *which specific interest nodes* they are dominating and how their engagement compares to the platform average for that niche."
faq_items:
  - question: "Is Social Blade still accurate for Shorts in 2026?"
    answer: "Social Blade provides high-level view counts, but in 2026, it lacks the deep **'Retention Proxy'** data that short-form creators need. Tools like **ContHunt** provide a more granular look at algorithmic traction."
  - question: "Are there any free competitor analysis tools in 2026?"
    answer: "Yes. **ContHunt Free** allows for basic node-level tracking, while native platform 'Creator Studios' have added more robust (but limited) 'Channels your audience watches' sections."
  - question: "What is the 'Node Overlap' feature in 2026 tools?"
    answer: "This 2026 innovation (pioneered by ContHunt) shows you exactly where your audience interests overlap with a competitor, identifying 'Tension Points' where you can win over their fans."
