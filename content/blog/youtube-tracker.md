## YouTube Tracking Best Practices for 2026

1.  **Track Competitors Weekly.** Check what competitors uploaded and how it performed.
2.  **Monitor View Velocity, Not Just Views.** A video that gets 50K views in 24 hours is a stronger signal than one that gets 50K over 6 months.
3.  **Watch for Outlier Content.** When a competitor publishes a video that performs 2x+ their average, study it closely—format, title, thumbnail, hook.
4.  **Track Shorts Separately.** YouTube Shorts have completely different performance patterns than long-form. Use separate benchmarks.
5.  **Set Up Alerts.** Don't check dashboards manually. Set up alerts for competitor uploads and keyword ranking changes.
