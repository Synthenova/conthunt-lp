# What Is a YouTube Short? Complete Guide for Beginners

YouTube Shorts is YouTube's answer to TikTok—a short-form video feature that has transformed how creators reach audiences and build channels.

If you're new to YouTube Shorts or considering creating them, this guide explains everything you need to know.

## Definition: What Is a YouTube Short?

A **YouTube Short** is a short-form vertical video that:

- **Is 60 seconds or less** in duration
- **Uses vertical 9:16 aspect ratio** (like smartphone screens)
- **Appears in the Shorts shelf** on YouTube's homepage and app
- **Loops continuously** when viewed
- **Uses short-form video** designed for mobile viewing

**Key Difference**: Unlike regular YouTube videos, Shorts are designed for quick, mobile-first consumption and compete in a separate discovery feed.

## How YouTube Shorts Work

### The Shorts Feed

Shorts appear in multiple places on YouTube:

| Location | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Shorts Shelf** | Homepage row dedicated to Shorts |
| **Shorts Tab** | Dedicated section in YouTube app |
| **Notifications** | Subscribers see Shorts in feed |
| **Search Results** | Shorts can appear in search |
| **Up Next** | Shorts may play after regular videos |

### The Algorithm

YouTube Shorts has its own recommendation algorithm that considers:

- **Watch percentage**: How many viewers watch to the end
- **Engagement**: Likes, comments, shares
- **Rewatches**: How many times viewers loop the video
- **Session time**: How long viewers stay watching Shorts
- **User preferences**: What viewers have watched before

> **Pro Tip**: Use [ContHunt's analytics](https://conthunt.app) to understand what content performs well in your niche.

## YouTube Shorts vs. Regular Videos

| Feature | Shorts | Regular Videos |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| **Duration** | Under 60 seconds | Any length |
| **Aspect Ratio** | Vertical (9:16) | Horizontal (16:9) typically |
| **Discovery** | Shorts feed | Search, recommendations, browse |
| **RPM** | $0.01-$0.08 per 1,000 views | $2-$10 per 1,000 views |
| **Production** | Quick, simple | More involved |
| **Focus** | Quick entertainment/info | Long-form consumption |

**Key Insight**: Shorts are better for reach and growth; regular videos are better for monetization and deep content.

## Why Shorts Matter for Creators

### 1. Massive Reach Potential

Shorts can go viral regardless of your channel size. The Shorts feed doesn't discriminate based on subscriber count—great content can reach millions.

### 2. Faster Growth

Many creators grow from 0 to 100,000 subscribers faster with Shorts than traditional content.

### 3. Lower Production Barrier

Shorts require less time, equipment, and editing expertise than long-form videos.

### 4. Algorithm Advantages

The Shorts algorithm aggressively promotes content that keeps viewers watching, giving new creators a chance to be discovered.

### 5. Funnel to Long-Form

Successful Shorts creators use short-form content to drive viewers to longer, more monetizable videos.

## Common Questions

### Are Shorts permanent?

Yes, Shorts stay on your channel permanently like regular videos. They continue to get views over time through search, recommendations, and the Shorts feed.

### Can I make money from Shorts?

Yes, through ad revenue (after qualifying), brand sponsorships, affiliate marketing, and by driving viewers to more monetizable long-form content.

### Do Shorts count toward watch time?

Shorts watch time counts differently than long-form. While it doesn't count toward the 4,000-hour requirement for YPP, YouTube has a separate Shorts monetization path.

### Can anyone see my Shorts?

Yes, Shorts are public videos (unless you set them to unlisted or private). They can appear in the Shorts feed for viewers who might not be subscribed to you.

### What's the difference between Shorts and TikTok?

While similar in format, Shorts has advantages:
- Built-in YouTube audience
- Integration with your existing channel
- Monetization through YouTube Partner Program
- Search visibility on Google
