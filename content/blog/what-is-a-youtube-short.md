  text: "In 2026, a **YouTube Short** is a vertical video up to 60 seconds long, delivered through the specialized 'Shorts Feed'. Unlike traditional YouTube videos, Shorts are driven by an **'Interest-Discovery'** algorithm that prioritizes immediate engagement (Viewed vs. Swiped Away) over search metadata. For the 2026 creator, Shorts serve as the 'Top-of-Funnel' awareness engine that drives viewers toward highly profitable long-form content."
faq_items:
  - question: "Are YouTube Shorts different from TikTok in 2026?"
    answer: "While the format is similar, YouTube Shorts are integrated into the broader Google search ecosystem. In 2026, a viral Short on YouTube often provides more **Long-Tail Search Views** over several months compared to the rapid decay of a TikTok video."
  - question: "Do I need a separate channel for YouTube Shorts in 2026?"
    answer: "No. In 2026, the YouTube algorithm is highly efficient at bridging Shorts and Long-Form content on a single channel. In fact, channels that post both tend to see higher overall subscriber retention."
  - question: "How much do YouTube Shorts pay in 2026?"
    answer: "Through the **Shorts Ad Revenue Sharing** model, creators earn a percentage of the revenue from ads shown in the Shorts feed. While the RPM is lower than long-form, the massive scale of the 2026 Shorts audience makes it a viable revenue stream for high-volume creators."

# What is a YouTube Short? The 2026 Creator's Guide

YouTube Shorts are no longer an "experiment"—they are a global phenomenon. In 2026, they represent the single biggest opportunity for new creators to get discovered. But to win, you have to understand that a Short is not just a "cut-down" version of a long video; it's a completely different algorithmic beast.

## 1. The Anatomy of a 2026 Short
To be classified as a Short in 2026, your video must meet these criteria:
*   **Orientation:** Vertical (9:16 aspect ratio).
*   **Duration:** Up to 60 seconds (though a 15-30s 'Sweet Spot' exists for viral growth).
*   **Metadata:** Must be uploaded to the YouTube Mobile App or tagged correctly if using a third-party intelligence layer like **ContHunt**.

## 2. Why Shorts Matter in 2026
*   **Algorithmic Discovery:** Traditional YouTube is "Pull" content (people search for it). Shorts are "Push" content (the algorithm puts it in front of people). This makes it the #1 way to get new subscribers in 2026.
*   **Interest Graph Integration:** YouTube uses your Shorts engagement data to understand what else you might like, creating a seamless bridge to long-form recommendations. 
*   **Repurposing Power:** Successful 2026 creators use **ContHunt** to normalize their Shorts data across TikTok and Reels, ensuring their highest-velocity hooks are working everywhere.

## 3. The "Viewed vs. Swiped Away" Metric
In 2026, this is the only number that truly matters in your Shorts analytics. 
*   **If 70% of viewers stay?** The algorithm will push your video to a "Tier 2" audience (approx. 100k - 500k views).
*   **If 85% stay?** Your video is on path for the "Global Trending" shelf.

## 4. How to Use ContHunt with Shorts
Generic analytics tell you what happened. **ContHunt** tells you *why*.
*   **Hook Deconstruction:** We analyze the first 3 seconds of your competitors' Shorts to see which visual "hooks" are preventing the swipe.
*   **Node Mapping:** See where your Shorts rank in the 2026 "Interest Nodes" (e.g., #productivity vs #tech-review). Alignment is the key to viral consistency.
