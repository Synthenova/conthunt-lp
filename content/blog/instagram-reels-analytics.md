  text: "In 2026, the single most important Instagram Reels metric is **Average Watch Duration vs. Duration (AVD/D)**. For a 30-second Reel to go viral, you need an AVD of at least 85% (25.5 seconds). If your retention drops below 50% in the first 3 seconds, the algorithm will cease pushing your content to non-followers immediately."

  - question: "Where do I find my Reels analytics in 2026?"
    answer: "Open the Instagram app, go to your profile, and tap 'Professional Dashboard.' Under 'Account Insights,' select 'Reels' for a detailed breakdown of plays, watch time, and re-watches."
  - question: "What is a good 'Save' rate for Reels in 2026?"
    answer: "A 'Healthy' save rate in 2026 is 1 save for every 100 views. If you are hitting 3 saves per 100 views, your content is considered 'High-Value' and will receive a significant boost in the Explore feed."
  - question: "Does the 'Watch Again' metric actually help reach?"
    answer: "Yes. In 2026, 'Watch Again' (re-watches) is a primary signal for content resonance. It tells the algorithm that your content is either high-information or high-entertainment, triggering a wider audience test."

# Instagram Reels Analytics: The 2026 Performance Guide

In 2026, analytics are no longer just about looking at your past—they are about **Predicting Your Future**. The Instagram Professional Dashboard has evolved into a sophisticated AI workstation that provides second-by-second insights into user behavior.

Follow this guide to master the data layer of your Reels strategy.

## 1. The Survival Metrics
In 2026, the algorithm has a "Low-Quality Filter" that checks two primary metrics within the first 100 views:
*   **The 3-Second Retention:** If less than 60% of people are still watching after 3 seconds, your video will be buried. This is the ultimate test of your **Hook**.
*   **Swipe-Away Rate:** A new metric for 2026 that tracks how quickly users move from your video to the next.

## 2. Advanced Engagement Signals
Beyond likes and comments, 2026 is about **Deep Engagement**:
*   **Expansion Rate:** How many people tapped "See More" on your caption.
*   **Profile Visit Velocity:** The number of viewers who go to your profile directly after watching a specific Reel.
*   **Sticker Interaction:** If you use polls or sliders, their engagement now contributes significantly to your "Community Score."

## 3. The "Node-Alignment" Dashboard
Instagram now provides a map of which **Interest Nodes** are consuming your content.
*   **Alignment:** If your Reels are reaching the 'Tech' and 'AI' nodes, you are successfully targeting your niche.
*   **Drift:** If you see 'Random' or 'Uncategorized' nodes, your hashtags or opening frames are too broad.

## 2026 Analysis Checklist
1.  **Check the Heatmap:** Where is the biggest drop-off frame?
2.  **Compare Duration:** Are your 15s Reels outperforming your 60s Reels?
3.  **Audit the Audio:** Is the "Original Audio" generating more saves than "Trending Audio"?
