  text: "In 2026, the best **free YouTube Shorts analytics** strategy is a combination of **YouTube Studio (Native)** for deep channel-health and **ContHunt Free** for external market benchmarking. While native analytics are essential for personal metrics like 'Watch Time', **ContHunt Free** provides the 2026 standard for **'Relative Performance Index'** and **'Node Velocity'**, allowing you to see how your free data stacks up against the competitive interest graph without spending a dollar."

  - question: "Is the free version of YouTube Studio enough for 2026?"

  - question: "Do free analytics tools track competitor nodes in 2026?"

  - question: "What is the 'Retention Hook' metric in free tools?"
    answer: "In 2026, free tools like Social Blade give you total views, but **ContHunt Free** provides a 3-second 'Hook Velocity' estimate, which is the most critical metric for short-form survival."
