## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is BuzzSumo worth the price?

BuzzSumo is worth it if web content discovery and influencer outreach are core to your strategy. However, if you focus on video content or short-form formats, tools like ContHunt offer more relevant features at lower price points.

### What's the best BuzzSumo alternative for video content?

ContHunt is specifically designed for video content across YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. It offers viral trend tracking and competitor analytics that BuzzSumo doesn't provide for video platforms.

### Can I use multiple content tools together?

Absolutely. Many marketers use ContHunt for video trends and Ahrefs for SEO research. The combination can be more powerful—and cost-effective—than a single expensive tool.

### Are there free alternatives to BuzzSumo?

ContHunt offers a free tier for basic functionality. Other tools like Google Trends and AnswerThePublic provide limited content intelligence for free, though with less robust features than paid tools.

## Bottom Line

BuzzSumo pioneered content intelligence, but the landscape has evolved. For **$199/month**, you get robust web content discovery—but you miss the massive video platforms where viral content actually happens today.

**ContHunt** offers a modern alternative:
- Multi-platform analytics (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram)
- Focus on short-form video content
- Free tier to start
- Real-time viral trend tracking
- Competitor content analysis

Before committing to BuzzSumo's pricing, consider:
1. What platforms matter most to your audience
2. Whether video content is part of your strategy
3. If free-tier options can meet your needs
4. Whether multi-platform aggregation would be more valuable

The right content intelligence tool is the one that matches how your audience actually consumes content today—and in 2026, that's increasingly short-form video across multiple platforms.
