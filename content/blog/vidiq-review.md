# vidIQ Review & Pricing 2026: Complete Guide

In the fast-moving social landscape of 2026, "SEO" has evolved beyond simple keywords. It is now a game of **Trend Alignment** and **Predictive Analytics**. vidIQ has reinvented itself several times over the last decade, but does it still hold the crown?

Here is our definitive 2026 review and pricing breakdown.

---

## Part 1: vidIQ Review - Is It Still the Best?

### The Core Value: "Daily Ideas"
The standout feature of vidIQ in 2026 is its AI-powered **Daily Ideas** engine.
*   **How it Works:** It analyzes your channel's historical data and cross-references it with global 2026 trends to suggest 5-50 specific video topics every single day.
*   **The 2026 Edge:** It doesn't just suggest topics; it predicts the "Potential" (Low, Medium, High, or Very High) of each idea based on current interest-node velocity.

### Competitive Intelligence (Real-Time Tracking)
vidIQ's competitor tools remain some of the best in the market.
*   **Trend Alerts:** Set notifications to see exactly when a rival in your niche has a "Velocity Spike."
*   **Top Subtitles & Keywords:** Deconstruct a rival's video in seconds to see which specific phrases are driving their search rank.

### SEO & Metadata Automation
In 2026, vidIQ makes the "Boring Stuff" (tags, descriptions, titles) almost instantaneous.
*   **AI Title Generator:** It provides 10+ variations of a title based on "Curiosity Gap" psychology.
*   **SEO Scorecard:** Provides an on-the-fly audit of your video's metadata before you hit publish.

### Where vidIQ Falls Short
While powerful, vidIQ still operates primarily as a **Channel-Centric** tool.
*   **The "Node" Gap:** It struggles to show you the broader "Interest Graph" crossover. This is where a specialized intelligence layer like **ContHunt** provides more value.
*   **Short-Form Retention:** While it has Shorts tools, it doesn't quite match the "Hook-Level" deconstruction offered by 2026 short-form specialists.

## Part 2: vidIQ Pricing 2026 - Complete Breakdown

### The Free Tier (Zero Cost)
*   **Best For:** Understanding the basics.
*   **Included:** 3 Daily Ideas, basic Keyword Inspector, and competitor tracking for 3 rivals.

### Pro ($10/Month)
*   **Best For:** Part-time creators.
*   **Included:** Full Keyword Research suite, historical data for competitors, and 'Best Time to Post' based on your specific audience activity.

### Boost ($49/Month)
*   **Best For:** Serious growth.
*   **Included:** AI Title & Description generator, A/B Testing, and advanced performance metrics. This is the tier where "Automation" starts to save you real time.

### Max ($99/Month)
*   **Best For:** Full-time pros and teams.
*   **Included:** Personalized coaching, high-volume AI credits, and multi-channel management features.

### Is "Boost" Worth It in 2026?
At $49/month, Boost is a significant investment.
*   **The Argument for 'Yes':** If the AI generator saves you just 3 hours a month, it has paid for itself.
*   **The Argument for 'No':** Many "Data" features in Boost are now available for free in the **YouTube Studio Research Tab**.

## Part 3: The Modular Stack Alternative

In 2026, many savvy creators are doing "Tool Splitting."
*   **The Strategy:** Link your **Free vidIQ** for basic Chrome extension utility, then use **ContHunt** for your **'Interest-Node'** and **'Retention Hook'** analysis.
*   **The Benefit:** You get deeper competitive intelligence for a similar (or lower) total monthly cost than the vidIQ Max plan.
