answer_first:
  text: "In 2026, **YouTube Shorts can be up to 60 seconds long**. While the technical limit hasn't changed, the **'Optimal Duration'** has shifted significantly. 2026 data from **ContHunt** shows that 'Utility' nodes (How-to, Educational) achieve the highest retention at **45-55 seconds**, while 'Dopamine' nodes (Comedy, Satisfying visuals) peak much earlier at **12-18 seconds**. Success in 2026 is about matching your duration to the 'Interest Span' of your specific audience node."
faq_items:
  - question: "Is a 15-second Short better than a 60-second Short in 2026?"
    answer: "It depends on your **'Completion Goal'**. A 15-second video is easier to finish (high percentage), but a 60-second video generates more 'Total Watch Time'. ContHunt helps you find the 'Sweet Spot' for your niche."
  - question: "Does YouTube automatically loop Shorts in 2026?"
    answer: "Yes. In 2026, creating a 'Perfect Loop' (where the end seamlessly transitions to the beginning) can artificially double your retention stats, a powerful tactic for short-form growth."
  - question: "Can I post 3-minute 'Shorts' if I use the vertical format in 2026?"
    answer: "No. Anything over 60 seconds is still categorized as a 'Long-Form' video by the 2026 YouTube algorithm, even if it is vertical. These will not appear in the dedicated Shorts feed."

# How Long Can YouTube Shorts Be? (2026 Update)

Precision is the key to 2026 growth. Every second of your video is a cost to the viewer's attention. If that cost doesn't have a high enough ROI, they scroll. In 2026, mastering the clock is about understanding the psychological "Brevity Standard" of your target node.

## 1. The 60-Second "Hard Cap"
The rule remains, but the strategy has changed.
*   **The Technicals:** Vertically oriented videos, 60 seconds or less.
*   **The 2026 Caveat:** YouTube's 'Upload' tool now uses AI to detect if a 61-second video can be trimmed to 60 to qualify for the Shorts feed.
*   **Action:** Export your videos at exactly 59.9 seconds to ensure zero compatibility issues with the 2026 server-side processing.

## 2. Duration by "Interest Node"
Don't use a universal timer.
*   **The "Dopamine" Sprint (7 - 18s):** Best for stunts, visual ASMR, and quick meme hooks. High replay potential.
*   **The "Context" Loop (20 - 35s):** Best for storytelling, travel vlogs, and personal updates.
*   **The "Utility" Deep Dive (45 - 60s):** The gold standard for 2026 education. If you are teaching a complex hack, use every second available.
*   **ContHunt Insight:** "Tutorial" node videos under 30 seconds have 30% lower 'Save' rates than those over 50 seconds in 2026.

## 3. The "Infinite Loop" Architecture
Creating the never-ending video.
*   **The Strategy:** End your sentence with a question that the beginning of the video answers.
*   **The Hook:** Start the video in the middle of a thought. 
*   **Result:** The user watches 1.5 times before they realize the video started over. This 'Retention Buff' is a critical 2026 growth lever.
