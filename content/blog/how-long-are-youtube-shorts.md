  text: "YouTube Shorts in 2026 are capped at 60 seconds. However, data shows the 'viral sweet spot' is 35-50 seconds. This length allows for enough depth to drive 'Saves' and 'Re-watches' while keeping retention above the critical 85% threshold."
faq_items:
  - question: "Can a YouTube Short be exactly 60 seconds?"
    answer: "Yes, but it's safer to aim for 58-59 seconds. Small encoding variations can sometimes push a 60-second file to 60.1 seconds, which disqualifies it from the Shorts feed."
  - question: "Does the length of a Short affect the CPM?"
    answer: "Indirectly. Longer Shorts (45-60s) tend to have higher engagement and better brand-safe signals, which can lead to better placement in the ad-revenue sharing pool."
  - question: "What is the best length for a 'looping' video?"
    answer: "For seamless loops, aim for 20-30 seconds. This is short enough to encourage immediate re-watching but long enough to provide a satisfying cycle of content."

# How Long are YouTube Shorts? 2026 Guide to Optimal Length

In the high-velocity world of short-form video, time is your most precious currency. One second too long, and you lose the viewer; one second too short, and you fail to deliver value. In 2026, the YouTube Shorts algorithm has become highly sophisticated at measuring not just *if* someone watched, but *how much* of the video they consumed relative to its total length.

Understanding the "math" of video duration is the first step to going viral.

## The Hard Limits: 60 Seconds or Bust

The fundamental rule has not changed: A YouTube Short must be **60 seconds or less**.
*   **The 60.1 Trap:** Be careful when exporting from editors like Premiere or CapCut. If your video is exactly 60:00, some platforms might interpret it as 60:01, which will cause YouTube to treat it as a standard "long-form" video. This prevents it from appearing in the Shorts carousel.
*   **The Aspect Ratio Rule:** Remember that duration only matters if the video is vertical (9:16). A 30-second horizontal video is not a Short; it’s just a very short video.

## Finding the "Viral Sweet Spot" in 2026

While 60 seconds is the limit, it is rarely the *goal*. Our data at **ContHunt**, after analyzing millions of viral hits in early 2026, shows a specific trend:

### 1. The "Micro-Short" (15-20 Seconds)
*   **Best for:** Visual jokes, seamless loops, and quick "vibe" content.
*   **Retention Goal:** 100%+. To go viral at 15 seconds, people usually need to watch the video *more than once*.

### 2. The "Authority Burst" (35-45 Seconds)
*   **Best for:** Educational tips, story-time, and "how-to" tutorials.
*   **Retention Goal:** 80-90%. This is the most common duration for high-performing educational and informational content. It’s long enough to build trust but short enough to keep the viewer’s attention.

### 3. The "Deep-Dive Short" (55-60 Seconds)
*   **Best for:** Complex storytelling or multi-step recipes.
*   **Retention Goal:** 70-75%. These are harder to pull off, but if the pacing is fast, they drive massive "Total Watch Time," which the 2026 algorithm favors for pushing content to new audiences.

## Retention vs. Duration: The Ultimate Trade-off

The algorithm doesn't care about the *number* of seconds; it cares about the **Average Percentage Viewed (APV)**.
*   A 10-second video with 100% APV provides 10 seconds of watch time.
*   A 50-second video with 50% APV provides 25 seconds of watch time.

In 2026, the algorithm generally prefers the 50-second video because it kept a user on the platform for longer, even if they didn't finish it. **Build for watch time, not just completion.**

## Strategy: How to Pace Your Short

1.  **The Hook (0-3s):** Stop the scroll.
2.  **The Meat (3-45s):** Deliver exactly what you promised in the hook without any filler.
3.  **The Loop/CTA (45-60s):** End with a cliffhanger or a very fast instruction to follow for more.

## Conclusion

The "perfect" length for a YouTube Short in 2026 is however long it takes you to deliver maximum value with zero fluff. Don’t stretch a 20-second idea into a 60-second video, and don’t rush a 60-second story into 30 seconds. Use tools like **ContHunt** to see the average duration of the top-performing videos in your specific niche, and aim to match that pacing.
