## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Weak Hooks

**Problem:** Boring or confusing first few seconds lose viewers immediately.

**Solution:** Front-load your most compelling content. Start with action, questions, or bold statements.

### Mistake 2: Poor Audio Quality

**Problem:** Bad audio makes content unwatchable regardless of visuals.

**Solution:** Use external microphone or quiet environment. Test audio before filming.

### Mistake 3: Inconsistent Branding

**Problem:** Random content doesn't build audience loyalty.

**Solution:** Maintain consistent themes, formats, and style across your Shorts.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Analytics

**Problem:** Creating without tracking results means random outcomes.

**Solution:** Review analytics weekly. Create more of what works.

### Mistake 5: Giving Up Too Soon

**Problem:** Most creators stop before finding what works.

**Solution:** Commit to 30-50 Shorts before evaluating strategy. Iterate and improve.
