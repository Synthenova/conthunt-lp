**Structure:**
1. **Hook (1-3 seconds):** Question, surprising fact, or problem statement
2. **Teaching (40-50 seconds):** Clear explanation with visual support
3. **Application (5-10 seconds):** How to use this knowledge
4. **CTA (2-3 seconds):** Subscribe, save, or follow-up question

**Quality Standards:**
- Information accuracy is non-negotiable
- Visual elements enhance (not decorate) learning
- Language is accessible to target age group
- Claims are supported by research when applicable
- Credits sources when appropriate

**Weekly Mix:**
- 40% Core Teaching (direct instruction of concepts)
- 30% Study Skills (meta-learning, strategies)
- 20% Motivation/Inspiration (why this matters)
- 10% Community/Interactive (Q&A, responses)

**Consistency Strategy:**
- Pick 2-3 subjects you'll cover (avoid being too broad)
- Create series around specific topics (builds returning audience)
- Post 3-5 times per week for algorithm favor
- Use consistent visual branding for recognition

## Measuring Educational Content Success

Educational content has different success metrics than entertainment:

**Key Metrics:**
- **Save rate:** High saves = practical value delivered

The most valuable engagement for educational creators is when viewers save your Short to rewatch or share with classmates—that's practical value in action.
