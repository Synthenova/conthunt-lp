# Viral YouTube Shorts Hooks: 100+ Hooks That Stop the Scroll

You have less than one second.

That's all the time you have to convince someone to stop scrolling and watch your YouTube Short. The difference between 100 views and 1 million views often comes down to what happens in that first second.

ContHunt's analysis of viral Shorts reveals that the top 1% of videos use specific hook patterns that trigger human psychology and stop the scroll.

This guide gives you 100+ proven hooks you can use immediately, organized by psychological trigger and content type.

## The Science of the Hook

### Why the First Second Matters

**Human Attention Span**: 8 seconds (and shrinking)
**Scroll Decision**: Made in 0.5-1 second
**Algorithm Testing**: Initial engagement (first few seconds) determines wider distribution

**The Hook's Job**:
1. **Stop the scroll** (visual + auditory interruption)
2. **Create curiosity** (gap between what they see and what they want to know)
3. **Promise value** (imply something worth their time)
4. **Trigger emotion** (surprise, curiosity, excitement)

### The Hook Formula

All viral hooks follow this structure:

**[Pattern Interrupt] + [Curiosity Gap] + [Value Promise]**

**Example**:
- **Pattern Interrupt**: "Stop doing this..."
- **Curiosity Gap**: "...thing you do every day"
- **Value Promise**: "...that's secretly ruining your progress"

## Testing Your Hooks

2. **Post at similar times** with consistent conditions
3. **Compare initial engagement** (first hour metrics)
4. **Identify winning patterns**
5. **Apply learnings** to future content

### Metrics That Matter

**Initial Performance** (First 1-6 hours):
- View-through rate
- Average view duration
- Engagement rate
- Audience retention at 3 seconds

**What Success Looks Like**:
- 50%+ view-through rate on first 3 seconds
- Above-average engagement for your channel
- Positive comments mentioning the hook

## Advanced Hook Strategies

### The Multi-Part Hook

Layer multiple hooks for maximum impact:

**Example**:
1. **Visual**: Sudden movement
2. **Audio**: "Wait!"
3. **Text**: "Stop scrolling"
4. **Voice**: "You're doing this wrong"

### The Open Loop Hook

Create information gap that requires watching to resolve:

**Example**: "The one thing that's secretly ruining your progress...I'll tell you what it is in 30 seconds, but first..."

### The Pattern Interrupt Hook

Break viewing expectations with unexpected element:

**Example**: Start mid-action, use unusual camera angle, or introduce unexpected element

## Action Plan: Master Your Hooks

**Week 1**: Research
- Save hooks from viral Shorts in your niche
- Document patterns you notice
- Identify hook types that resonate

**Week 2**: Create Hook Library
- Write 10-20 hooks for each content type
- Create fill-in-the-blank templates
- Organize by topic and format

**Week 3-4**: Test
- Apply new hooks to your content
- Track which perform best
- Refine based on data

**Ongoing**: Continuously test and iterate based on performance

## Conclusion

Your hook is the gatekeeper of your YouTube Shorts success. Even the most amazing content will fail without a hook that stops the scroll.

The creators getting millions of views aren't necessarily making better content—they're mastering that first second with hooks that trigger curiosity and emotion.

Start treating your hooks with the importance they deserve. Test, iterate, and optimize until you find what works for your specific audience and niche.
