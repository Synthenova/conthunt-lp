answer_first:
  text: "In 2026, **Instagram Reels can be up to 90 seconds long** when recorded in the app, and up to **15 minutes** when uploaded as a video (which Instagram then categorizes as a Reel). However, the 2026 **'Algorithmic Sweet Spot'** remains much shorter. Data from **ContHunt** indicates that the highest 'Viral Velocity' on Instagram occurs for Reels between **15 and 30 seconds**. This duration allows for a high hook-retention rate while providing enough 'Total Watch Time' to trigger a wide algorithmic push in the Explore feed."
faq_items:
  - question: "Why is my 90-second Reel not getting views in 2026?"
    answer: "In 2026, user patience on the Reels feed is at an all-time low. If your video doesn't provide a 'Micro-Payoff' every 5 seconds, viewers scroll. ContHunt benchmarks show that 90-second Reels have a 40% lower 'Completion Rate' than 30-second ones."
  - question: "Does the length of a Reel affect its discovery on Facebook in 2026?"
    answer: "Yes. Longer Reels (60s+) perform better on the Facebook 'Watch' tab, while shorter Reels dominate the 'Direct Feed'. If you want cross-platform discovery, 30-60 seconds is the target."
  - question: "Can I use the 'Looping' trick on Reels in 2026?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Just like Shorts, a 'Seamless Loop' on a 15-second Reel can drive your 'Average Watch Time' above 100%, which is a primary signal for the 2026 Instagram AI."

# How Long Can an Instagram Reel Be? (2026 Guide)

Complexity has returned to the Reels feed. In 2026, Instagram has moved away from the "One-Size-Fits-All" approach to video length. To succeed, you must understand the distinction between what the platform *allows* and what the audience *demands*. 

## 1. The "Dual-Limit" System
Recording vs. Uploading in 2026.
*   **The 90-Second Limit:** If you use the Reels camera and its native effects, you are capped at 90 seconds. 
*   **The 15-Minute Rule:** Any video under 15 minutes uploaded to Instagram is now treated as a 'Reel'.
*   **The Strategy:** For 'Educational' or 'Long-Form Narrative' nodes, use the upload feature to hit the 2-3 minute mark. For 'Trend' nodes, stick to the 90-second native limit.

## 2. Platform-Specific "Interest Spans"
Instagram is the "Boutique" of short-form.
*   **The Comparison:** While TikTok users tolerate longer, raw content, Reels users in 2026 favor **'Visual Density'**. 
*   **ContHunt Tip:** A 20-second Reel with high-tier color grading and fast transitions will outperform a 60-second raw 'vlog' style video in most 2026 interest nodes.
*   **Benchmarking:** Use ContHunt to track the #aesthetic node in your niche to see the current duration standards.

## 3. Designing for the "Global Feed"
Length affects who sees your content.
*   **The Explore Feed:** Prioritizes high-velocity, short Reels (under 30s).
*   **The Home Feed:** Prioritizes longer content from creators users already follow.
*   **Recommendation:** Use short Reels to find new fans and longer Reels to keep them.
