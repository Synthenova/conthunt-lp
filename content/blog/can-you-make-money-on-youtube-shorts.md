# Can You Make Money on YouTube Shorts in 2026? The Honest Truth

The question of whether you can make money on YouTube Shorts is more relevant than ever in 2026. With billions of daily views and a mature monetization system, YouTube Shorts has become a viable career path for millions of short-form creators. However, the path to a sustainable income requires understanding the nuances of how YouTube pays and what other revenue streams are available.

## The Foundation: The YouTube Partner Program (YPP)

In 2026, the primary way to earn money directly from YouTube for your Shorts is through the **YouTube Partner Program**. Unlike the early days of the "Shorts Fund," creators now have a permanent and predictable way to share in the advertising revenue generated by the platform.

### Ad Revenue Sharing
YouTube aggregates all the advertising revenue from ads shown between videos in the Shorts feed. After paying for music licensing, 45% of the remaining revenue is distributed to creators based on their share of total Shorts views.

### Requirements to Qualify
To join the YPP and start receiving ad revenue, you must meet the following eligibility criteria:
1.  **Gain 1,000 subscribers.**
2.  **Get 10 million valid public Shorts views within 90 days.**
    *(Alternatively, you can qualify with 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 valid public watch hours on long-form videos).*

## Realistic Earnings: What to Expect

It’s important to manage expectations regarding ad revenue. Because Shorts are brief and high-volume, the **RPM (Revenue Per Mille)** is significantly lower than that of traditional long-form videos.

*   **Average RPM:** Most creators in 2026 report making between **$0.01 and $0.07 per 1,000 views**.
*   **The Math:** Generating 1 million views might only net you $10 to $70 in direct ad revenue.

While these numbers seem small, the viral potential of Shorts means that achieving millions of views is much more common than with 10-minute videos.

## Diversifying Your Income: Beyond Ads

Successful 2026 creators don't rely solely on YouTube’s ad share. Here are the most effective ways to supplement your income:

### 1. Brand Deals and Sponsorships
This is where the real money is. Brands are eager to tap into the high engagement rates of short-form video. A single sponsored Short for a creator with a loyal niche audience can pay anywhere from $500 to $10,000+.

### 2. Fan Funding (Super Thanks)
Viewers can purchase "Super Thanks" on your individual Shorts to show their appreciation. You receive a portion of this payment directly, allowing your most dedicated fans to support you.

### 3. Channel Memberships
If you provide extra value—such as behind-the-scenes content or exclusive community access—you can charge a monthly subscription fee for memberships.

### 4. Affiliate Marketing
By including links in your pinned comments or channel bio, you can earn a commission on products you recommend in your Shorts. This is particularly effective for tech, fashion, and beauty niches.

## The Strategy for Success in 2026

To maximize your earnings, follow these principles:
*   **Focus on a Niche:** Advertisers pay more for targeted audiences (e.g., finance, tech) than for general entertainment.
*   **Optimize for Retention:** Higher retention rates signal to the algorithm to keep pushing your video, leading to more views and more ad revenue.
*   **Build a Brand:** Use Shorts as a "discovery engine" to lead viewers to your newsletter, products, or long-form content where the margins are higher.

## Conclusion

Yes, you can absolutely make money on YouTube Shorts in 2026. While the direct ad revenue per view is low, the sheer volume of discovery and the secondary income streams (sponsorships, memberships, affiliates) make it one of the most powerful platforms for digital creators today.
