# Can You Make Money on YouTube Shorts? Complete 2026 Guide

The short answer is **yes, you can make money on YouTube Shorts**—but the path to profitability might look different than you expect. While direct ad revenue from Shorts is modest, successful creators have built six-figure incomes through strategic monetization approaches.

In this guide, we'll break down every revenue stream available to Shorts creators and show you how to build a sustainable income from short-form content.

## Quick Overview: How Shorts Creators Make Money

| Monetization Method | Income Potential | Difficulty |
|---------------------|------------------|------------|
| YouTube Ad Revenue | $10-$500/month | Easy (after qualifying) |
| Brand Sponsorships | $500-$10,000+/deal | Medium |
| Affiliate Marketing | 5-30% commission | Easy |
| Memberships & Donations | $100-$5000/month | Medium |
| Product Sales | Unlimited | Hard |
| Funneling to Long-Form | Indirect revenue | Medium |

## YouTube Shorts Ad Revenue: The Basics

YouTube Shorts generates ad revenue through ads that play between videos in the Shorts feed. Here's what you need to know:

### YouTube Partner Program Requirements for Shorts

To qualify for ad revenue from Shorts, you need to meet one of these thresholds:

**Option A: Shorts-Specific Path**
- 10 million valid public Shorts views in the past 90 days

**Option B: Traditional Path**
- 1,000 subscribers
- 4,000 public watch hours in the past 12 months

Once you qualify and join the YouTube Partner Program, you'll earn revenue from both your Shorts and long-form content.

### How Much Does YouTube Pay for Shorts?

YouTube Shorts RPM (Revenue Per 1,000 views) typically ranges from **$0.01 to $0.08**. This means:

| Monthly Views | Estimated Earnings |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 100,000 | $1 - $8 |
| 500,000 | $5 - $40 |
| 1,000,000 | $10 - $80 |
| 5,000,000 | $50 - $400 |
| 10,000,000 | $100 - $800 |

While these numbers may seem modest, many creators use Shorts to build audiences that then monetize through more lucrative long-form videos.

## Using Shorts to Drive Long-Form Revenue

One of the most effective monetization strategies is using Shorts to funnel viewers to your long-form content, where RPM is significantly higher ($2-$10 per 1000 views vs. $0.01-$0.08 for Shorts).

```
Shorts (High Growth, Low RPM)
    ↓
Direct viewers to long-form videos
    ↓
Long-form Content (Moderate Growth, High RPM)
    ↓
Monetize with ads + memberships
```

### Tactics to Drive Long-Form Views

1. **"Part 2" content**: Create a Short that references a longer video
2. **Teaser content**: Show highlights that make viewers want the full version
3. **Direct CTAs**: Ask viewers to visit your channel for the full story
4. **Pinned comments**: Use the first comment to link to related long-form content

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many views do you need to make money on YouTube Shorts?

For ad revenue, you need 10 million public Shorts views in 90 days OR 1,000 subscribers with 4,000 watch hours. For brand deals, creators can start earning with as few as 10,000 followers.

### Do YouTube Shorts pay as well as long videos?

No. Shorts RPM ($0.01-$0.08) is much lower than long-form ($2-$10). However, Shorts grow audiences faster and can lead to other revenue streams.

### Can you monetize Shorts without being in the YouTube Partner Program?

Yes! You can earn through brand sponsorships, affiliate marketing, and selling your own products without being in YPP. However, you need YPP for ad revenue and memberships.

### Is it worth making YouTube Shorts for money?

Yes, if you have a comprehensive monetization strategy. Relying solely on ad revenue from Shorts is difficult, but combining multiple income streams makes Shorts profitable for many creators.

## Bottom Line

**Yes, you can make money on YouTube Shorts**—but the most successful creators don't rely on ad revenue alone. By combining multiple monetization streams (ad revenue, brand deals, affiliate marketing, memberships, and product sales), you can build a sustainable income from short-form content.

Start by focusing on creating valuable, engaging content that attracts a loyal audience. Then, layer in monetization methods that make sense for your niche and audience. Use tools like [ContHunt](https://conthunt.app) to track your performance and optimize your content strategy based on real data.

The key is patience: Most successful Shorts creators took 6-12 months of consistent posting before reaching significant income levels. Start today, stay consistent, and diversify your revenue streams for the best chance at success.
