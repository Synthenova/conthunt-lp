## VidIQ Free Plan: What You Actually Get

### Free Plan Features

- **3 daily video audits** - Limited SEO analysis
- **Basic keyword research** - Surface-level search data
- **Chrome extension** - Basic overlay on YouTube
- **Channel health score** - Simple performance metric
- **Tag recommendations** - Automated suggestions

### Free Plan Limitations

| Feature | Limitation | Impact |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Daily audits | 3 per day | Can't audit full backlog |
| Keyword research | Limited depth | Misses long-tail opportunities |
| Competitor tracking | Basic only | No deep competitive intel |
| Bulk processing | Not available | Manual workflow required |
| Multi-platform | None | YouTube-only analytics |

### Who Is Free For?

The free tier works for:
- **Hobbyists** posting occasionally
- **Testing** before committing financially
- **Learning** basic YouTube SEO
- **One-off audits** rather than ongoing optimization

### When Free Falls Short

You'll outgrow free quickly if:
- Posting daily and need more audits
- Running a growing channel
- Need competitive analysis
- Want data-driven optimization

## VidIQ Pro Plan ($7.50/month)

### Pro Features Breakdown

| Feature | Included? | Value |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Daily video audits | 50 | Moderate volume |
| Keyword research | Full | Core SEO value |
| Tag optimization | Yes | Metadata help |
| Description templates | Yes | Time savings |
| Competitor tracking | Basic | Limited intel |
| Bulk processing | No | Manual workflow |

### Is Pro Worth $7.50/month?

**Yes, if:**
- You're actively growing a YouTube channel
- You care about YouTube SEO
- You post 3+ times per week
- $7.50/month fits your budget

**No, if:**
- You also post to TikTok (no analytics there)
- You need multi-platform competitive analysis
- You're a casual creator posting occasionally

**ROI Calculation:** If Pro helps one additional video rank higher and gain 10K extra views, you've likely gotten your money's worth. But consider: could multi-platform analytics deliver exponentially more value?

---

## VidIQ Boost Plan ($39/month)

### Boost Features Breakdown

| Feature | Included? | Value |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Daily audits | 100 | High volume |
| Bulk processing | Yes | Time savings |
| Tag suggestions | Advanced | Better SEO |
| Thumbnail A/B testing | Yes | CTR optimization |
| Coaching access | Limited | Learning value |
| Competitor intelligence | Enhanced | Better insights |

### Is Boost Worth $39/month?

At more than 5x the Pro price, Boost needs to deliver 5x the value. For many creators, this is where pricing starts feeling steep—especially when you consider what $39/month gets you elsewhere.

**Boost makes sense for:**
- Full-time YouTubers
- Channels posting daily
- Teams managing multiple channels
- Creators relying on YouTube as primary income

**Consider alternatives if:**
- You're on a budget
- You need TikTok analytics too
- You're not full-time on YouTube

## VidIQ Max Plan ($79/month)

### Max Features Breakdown

| Feature | Included? | Value |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| All Boost features | Yes | - |
| Daily audits | Unlimited | No constraints |
| Advanced coaching | Yes | Education |
| Priority support | Yes | Faster help |
| Custom branding | Yes | White label option |
| Multiple users | Up to 3 | Team access |

### The $79/month Reality Check

At $79/month ($948/year), VidIQ Max is a significant investment. That's nearly $1,000 annually for YouTube-only analytics.

For context, $79/month could get you:
- Full multi-platform analytics (YouTube + TikTok)
- Advanced trend scouting across platforms
- Competitive analysis on multiple networks
- More comprehensive creator tools

**Max makes sense if:**
- YouTube is your ONLY platform
- You're earning enough to justify the cost
- You have a team needing multiple seats
- You've maximized lower tiers

## VidIQ vs ContHunt: Pricing Comparison

The real question isn't "Is VidIQ worth it?" but rather "Is single-platform analytics worth it in 2026?"

### Side-by-Side Pricing Comparison

| Feature | VidIQ Pro | VidIQ Max | ContHunt Free | ContHunt Pro |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Monthly Price** | $7.50 | $79 | $0 | TBD |
| **YouTube Analytics** | Full | Full | Full | Full |
| **TikTok Analytics** | None | None | Basic | Full |
| **Shorts Focus** | Basic | Advanced | Advanced | Advanced |
| **Competitor Tracking** | YouTube only | YouTube only | Multi-platform | Multi-platform |
| **Trend Scouting** | YouTube only | YouTube only | YouTube + TikTok | YouTube + TikTok |
| **Daily Audits** | 50 | Unlimited | Limited | High volume |

### The Multi-Platform Value Proposition

**VidIQ Scenario:**
- YouTube analytics: $7.50/month (Pro)
- TikTok analytics: Need separate tool (~$10-20/month)
- Instagram Reels: Another separate tool (~$15/month)
- **Total: $32-50/month for fragmented analytics**

**ContHunt Scenario:**
- YouTube + TikTok analytics in one dashboard
- Single subscription for multi-platform insights
- Unified competitive analysis
- **Total: Significantly less for more capability**

## VidIQ Pricing FAQ

### Is VidIQ Pro worth the money?

At $7.50/month, VidIQ Pro delivers solid value for YouTube-focused creators. The keyword research and audit features can easily justify the cost if they help improve performance on even a few videos.

### How much does VidIQ cost per year?

VidIQ Pro costs $71.88/year (paid annually), VidIQ Boost is $372/year, and VidIQ Max is $756/year. Annual pricing saves approximately 20% compared to monthly billing.

### Does VidIQ have a free trial?

VidIQ has a permanent free tier rather than a time-limited trial. The free plan has feature limitations but doesn't expire, allowing you to test indefinitely before upgrading.

### Is VidIQ or TubeBuddy cheaper?

VidIQ Pro ($7.50/mo) and TubeBuddy Pro ($6/mo) are similarly priced. Both offer more expensive tiers with additional features. Pricing alone shouldn't decide—features and platform support matter more.

### Why pay for analytics when YouTube Studio is free?

YouTube Studio provides basic analytics. Paid tools like VidIQ and ContHunt offer competitive intelligence, advanced keyword research, trend forecasting, and actionable recommendations that free tools don't provide.

## Bottom Line: Making the Right Choice

VidIQ pricing is competitive for YouTube-only analytics, and the Pro tier at $7.50/month provides legitimate value for creators focused exclusively on YouTube.

**But in 2026, most creators aren't YouTube-only.**

If you're posting across YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels, single-platform analytics create blind spots. You're either missing data entirely or juggling multiple subscriptions.

**Our recommendation:**

1. **YouTube-only creators:** VidIQ Pro is a solid investment
2. **Multi-platform creators:** Compare VidIQ Max pricing to ContHunt's multi-platform offering
3. **Budget-conscious:** Start with ContHunt's free tier covering multiple platforms
4. **Growing teams:** Evaluate total cost of ownership across all your tools

The best analytics tool isn't the cheapest—it's the one that covers your entire content strategy without blind spots.
