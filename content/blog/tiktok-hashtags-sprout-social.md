# How to Use TikTok Hashtags for Maximum Views

Hashtags are essential for discoverability on TikTok. When used correctly, they help the algorithm understand your content and show it to the right audience.

## Why Hashtags Matter on TikTok

TikTok's algorithm uses hashtags to categorize content and recommend it to users who have shown interest in similar topics. Here's how to leverage them effectively:

### The 3-5 Hashtag Strategy

Research and experts recommend using 3-5 hashtags per video:

- **1-2 Niche Hashtags**: Highly specific to your content
- **1-2 Industry Hashtags**: Broader but still relevant
- **1 Trending Hashtag**: Capitalize on current trends

## Types of Hashtags to Use

### 1. Niche Hashtags
These are specific to your content area. They may have lower view counts but attract highly targeted audiences.

### 2. Industry Hashtags
Broader tags relevant to your general category or industry.

### 3. Trending Hashtags
Current viral hashtags that can boost initial visibility. Use these strategically.

## Best Practices

### Do:
- Research relevant hashtags before posting
- Use a mix of high and low competition tags
- Check what's trending in your niche
- Place hashtags in the caption, not just comments

### Don't:
- Use unrelated hashtags
- Overload with too many tags
- Use banned or flagged hashtags
- Copy hashtags from viral videos without context

## Measuring Hashtag Performance

Track which hashtags drive the most views and engagement. TikTok's analytics show you which hashtags are performing best for your content.
