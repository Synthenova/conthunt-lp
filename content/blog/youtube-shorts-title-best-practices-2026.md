answer_first:
  text: "In 2026, **YouTube Shorts Titles** have transitioned from 'Click-to-Open' to **'Semantic Indexing'**. Because Shorts auto-play, the title's primary job is to tell the algorithm *who* to show the video to, rather than convince the user to click. The 2026 'Elite' format is a **'Topic + Action'** pairing (e.g., 'Notion Tips for 2026'). Using **ContHunt** to track 'Title Velocity' (which phrasing is currently dominating the niche search nodes) can increase your 'Discovery-to-View' conversion by up to 250%."
faq_items:
  - question: "Should I use ALL CAPS in my YouTube Shorts titles in 2026?"
    answer: "No. In 2026, the AI's 'Sentiment Analysis' interprets all-caps as 'Low-Quality Spam'. Use **Sentence Case** with capital letters only for emphasis or proper nouns to maintain brand authority."
  - question: "Do hashtags in the title help with views in 2026?"
    answer: "Yes, but only **one**. Including one 'Node Tag' (e.g., #productivity) in the title helps the AI categorize the video instantly. More than one tag reduces the 'Semantic Clarity' of the headline."
  - question: "How long should a Shorts title be in 2026?"
    answer: "The 'Sweet Spot' is **40 to 60 characters**. In 2026 mobile feeds, anything longer than 60 characters is truncated, hiding your 'Result Hook' from the viewer."

# YouTube Shorts Title Best Practices for 2026

Your title is the **"DNA"** of your video. In 2026, the algorithm "Reads" your title before it ever "Shows" your video. If your title is vague (e.g., "Wait for it..."), the AI has no meta-data to work with, and your reach will be limited to a random, unengaged audience. To win, you must title for the **Machine** first and the **Human** second.

## 1. The "Semantic Hook" Structure
Avoid the guessing game. Give the AI exactly what it needs.
*   **The Idea:** Use a **[Target Keyword]** + **[Specific Action/Result]**.
*   **Example:** "YouTube Shorts SEO: The 10-second fix for 2026."
*   **ContHunt Insight:** "Action-Oriented" titles have an 88% higher 'Audience Fit' score than descriptive or poetic titles.

## 2. The "Number Logic" for Retention
Numbers are the universal language of utility.
*   **The Idea:** Include a specific count or percentage to quantify the value.
*   **Example:** "How I saved **40 hours** with this AI trick."
*   **Node Alignment:** This triggers the "Efficiency" and "Results" nodes, which are high-retention drivers for the 2026 algorithm.

## 3. Emoji Etiquette in 2026
Emojis are no longer just for fun; they are **Semantic Markers**.
*   **The Idea:** Use one emoji at the *start* of the title to visually identify the niche (e.g., 💻 for tech, 🥗 for food).
*   **The Limit:** Never use more than two emojis. 2026 spam filters flag 'Emoji Overload' as a negative quality signal.
*   **Success Index:** **ContHunt** identifies that 'Niche-Specific' emoji use increases CTR in the channel feed by 20%.

## 4. Top 10 Title Templates for 2026 (via ContHunt)
1. "[Goal] in 15 Seconds: The 2026 Guide"
2. "Why every [Role] is switching to [Topic]..."
3. "The sound of a perfect [Action] 🔊"
4. "The $0 fix for your [Common Problem]"
5. "POV: You found the [Topic] secret."
6. "The math behind [Result] in 2026."
7. "This is legally a cheat code for [Goal]..."
8. "How I turned [Problem] into [Solution] fast."
9. "The 1% trick for [Topic] mastery."
10. "The algorithm thinks you're ready for this [Niche] secret..."

## 2026 Title Strategy Checklist
*   [ ] Is the primary keyword in the first 30 characters?
*   [ ] Does the title follow the 'Topic + Action' semantic structure?
*   [ ] Have I limited emojis to 1-2 relevant markers?
*   [ ] Have I checked the 'Title Velocity' for this niche in ContHunt?
